After upgrading to vBulletin 5.X or 6.x the private messages of some users may hang. The most common cause of this issue is that the character_set_client is set to utf8mb4 but the database is using a latin1 character set. This state can occur when upgrading from versions of MySQL older than 8.0.

Converting the database to utf8mb4 with the provided tools should resolve the issue. If it doesn't resolve the issue, then we can forward a database to the developers. See [Database Tools](Database%20Tools.md) for more information.
