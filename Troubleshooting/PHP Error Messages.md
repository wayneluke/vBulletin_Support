- **Warning**: Runtime messages about the state of the PHP script. Could be a bad reference to another file or an undeclared variable. This does not stop the operation of the script. In vBulletin, these can generall be ignored.
- **Notice**: Similar to Warning but it is a little more serious in that it could indicate an error.
- **Deprecated**: indicates code or a variable construct that will cause errors in a future version of PHP. These should be reported as bugs in the vBulletin Bug Tracker if they occur on the latest version of vBulletin.
- **Fatal Error**: Kills the script. This would be invalid code or an upstream error. If it indicates a missing function/method, then make sure the server meets the minimum requirements.

## Error Log Location

The location of the error log can often be found in the PHP Info output. You can see this in vBulletin within the AdminCP under Maintenance â†’ View PHP Info. The path will be listed with the error_log variable.
