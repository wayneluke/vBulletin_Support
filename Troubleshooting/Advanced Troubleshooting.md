These are the steps that I go through for advanced troubleshooting. Using these steps will often give more information more than debug mode alone.

## Restrict Debug Mode Access.

Debug mode can provide too much information to site visitors so it is best to limit who can see this. Previously I have documented two two ways of implementing this. 

1. [[Debug Mode by IP]]
2. [[Debug Mode by Lock File]]

Use the one that suits your needs the best.

## Force Error Logging
