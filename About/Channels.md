vBulletin offers users several different content types to choose from. As the site administrator, you can control who has access to these via channel permissions.

These content types are:

- Text - This is the default content type. Users just have to add their text to the post and save it. Text content is used for replies and comments as well as topic starters.
- Photo Galleries - Requires one or more photos to be uploaded. The system will show a small number of photos thumbnails and when clicking on one opens a Lightbox navigation system. Users can page through all the photos in this gallery using the Lightbox. Each image uploaded can have its own title and description. If a title isn't provided, the image name is used. Users can add a photo gallery as a topic starter or reply.
- Link / Video - This type is typically used to link to outside sources of content. Link/Video content requires a URL to the external content. Once provided, the system will attempt to retrieve the page title, a thumbnail, and a description. If the link is to a supported video site like YouTube or Vimeo, the user will be able to play the video inline.

- Content Types via Channel Types. The differences between the two are subtle because Articles and Blogs can also be considered types of content.
