 vBulletin comes with a variety of basic pages created when you first install or upgrade to it. However you may wish to add custom pages for a variety of reasons. At the end of this article, we will walk you through an example of making a page for your site. 

To begin editing pages, you will need to enable [Site Builder](https://forum.vbulletin.com/node/4497082). Once Site Builder is enabled, click on the New Page link.

## Page Components

### Modules

This opens a form with three tabs. For the moment, start with the **Add Module** tab in the form. Modules are the blocks and components used to build [[Pages]]. Each modules has a variety of options to control how it operates on a page and who has permission to view it.

### Layouts

Layouts are used to create the basic column structure of [[Pages]]. In vBulletin, a layout provides a number sections in which to place Modules. There are at least 5 sections per layout. These include a header global section, a 100% header section, one or more columns for general content modules, a 100% footer section and a footer global section.

### Templates

Page Templates are a combination of the selected Layout and Modules added to a page. Using Page Templates allows reuse without investing time in further configuration. Page Templates are often used in Channels where repeated configuration is desirable.
