With vBulletin, you can customize your channels to automatically close topics.  Expired topics will still be visible but will be automatically closed so no further replies can be made to that topic.

## Configuration

1. Log into the AdminCP
2. Go to Channel Management â†’ Channel Manager.
3. Edit the channel that you wish to expire content within.
4. Scroll to the options at the bottom of the page.
5. Set Topic Expiry to either last activity or days after topic was posted. 
6. Set the number of days for the topic expiration.

If you look at the image, you can see that "Expire X Days after last activity" was selected and the time limit was set to 90 days
