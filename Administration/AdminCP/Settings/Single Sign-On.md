The software allows Single Sign-on via Facebook, Google, and Twitter. You can also purchase an Add-on to integrate single sign-on with an existing LDAP server.  
  
Most of the documentation for the product is actually in the product and if you have a Demo working right now, you can see the configuration settings for these in the AdminCP under Settings → Options → Facebook Options and Settings → Options → Third-Party Login Options.
