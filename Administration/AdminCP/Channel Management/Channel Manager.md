  
The **Channel Manager**, accessible via Channel Management> Channel Manager, is where you can choose to do a portion of your channel management. This is in addition to the management that you can do through the **Site Builder** function. Unlike the **Site Builder**, the **Channel Manager** gives you an overview of all the Channels in a central location.  
  
When you enter this section, you will be presented with a screen similar to this:  
    
  
**Forum**  
Each row in the table is a channel in the database. In the first column, **Title**, you will see the name of the forum; clicking the name will allow you to edit the forum’s information.  
  
**Controls**  
The dropdown list in the next column of the **Channel Manager** has several options and will take you to other parts of vBulletin. The following is a list of the options and what they do:

- **Edit Forum** - this takes you to a page where you can edit each of the selected channel’s settings.
- **View Forum** - this displays the channel on the front end, allowing you to see the information posted to it.
- **Delete Forum** - this allows you to remove the channel from the database. If this channel has any sub-channels, they will also be removed.
- **Add Child Forum** - this takes you to the Add New Forum page with this forum automatically selected as the new forum’s parent.
- **Add Moderator** - this allows you to specify a new moderator for this channel.
- **Add Announcement** - this allows you to create a new announcement to be displayed at the top of the selected channel.
- **View Permissions** - this displays the Channel Permissions Manager and scrolls to the selected channel.

**Display Order**  
This controls the order in which the channels are displayed.  
  
**Moderators**  
The options in this dropdown list allow you to view and add moderators for a channel.

- **Moderators (x)** – this simply displays the number of moderators for this forum. It is not a clickable link.
- **Add Moderators** – this opens a form for you to add new moderators to the channel.
