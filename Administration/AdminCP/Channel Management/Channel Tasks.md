Channel Tasks allow you to expire (close) and delete topics after a specified amount of time has occurred. This can be triggered based on datestamp of the last reply to the topic or the datestamp of the opening post. Each channel can have its own settings and time limits for its tasks. 

Administrators can create Channel Tasks in the AdminCP under Channel Management â†’ Channel Tasks.
