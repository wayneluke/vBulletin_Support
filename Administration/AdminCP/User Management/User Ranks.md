Users ranks are rank insignia based on post count and usergroup that are displayed next to names in posts. User ranks work very similar to user titles, the main difference being that user titles are for all usergroups while user ranks can be created for specific usergroups. In this way you can create different rank insignia for different usergroups. User ranks appear under display names within posts.

## User Rank Manager

The User Rank Manager lists all of your existing your ranks. Here you can manage ranks based on post count for one or all usergroups. Ranks can be represented by images or text (HTML is allowed).  

The ranks are grouped by their group and listed by priority. The "User Rank" column shows the image or text that is granted to the user when they qualify for the corresponding rank. The "Minimum Posts" column shows you the post count that is needed to acquire the corresponding rank.  
  
Click the [Edit] link to the right of a rank to change its target usergroup, minimum required post count, and the image / text that creates the rank. Click the [Delete] link to delete the rank completely.
## Rank Grouping

If a User Rank's Rank Grouping is non-empty, it is considered grouped. Leave this empty to make the User Rank ungrouped.  Grouping only comes into affect when a user is qualified for multiple User Ranks. Within a grouping, only the highest Priority rank will be shown (see Priority help for more details).  Unliked grouped ranks, all ungrouped ranks that the user is qualified for will be shown.

## Rank Priority

If a user is qualified for multiple User Ranks for a given Rank Grouping, only the rank with the highest Priority value will be shown.  If multiple qualifying ranks have the same highest Priority, all ranks sharing that Priority in that Grouping will be displayed.  Priority is only used for sorting in ungrouped User Ranks. All qualified ungrouped ranks are displayed regardless of individual priority value.
