The [[Administrator]] Control Panel or AdminCP for short allows you to control settings, options, styles, languages and more for your site.

## Logging into the AdminCP

The Administrator Control Panel is available to control many aspects of your vBulletin site. This includes user management, channel management and permissions, and many other features. The Administrator Control Panel is frequently refered to as the AdminCP. Today, I am going to show you how to access and use this tool.

1. When visiting your site, login with the Administrator user that you created during creation.

2. Once logged in, click the Edit Site button to the right of your username.

3. This will trigger the Site Builder Menu at the top of your screen.

4. Click on the button labeled "AdminCP" to link to the Administrator Control Panel.

5. You will see a screen asking for your username and password. If you have Multifactor Authentication enabled, you will also see a field for your one-time passcode from your favorite authentication app.

6. Once you are logged in you will see the AdminCP

## AdminCP Overview

The AdminCP has three different sections that provide different information.

- The header will provide information on your current version and whether an update is available. In addition to this, there will be indicators if your site is turned off or in Debug Mode.
- The left navigation will provide navigation links to all of the sections of vBulletin. Going through each one is beyond the scope of this video but future videos can be made to cover each section.
- The main work area is in the right corner. vBulletin's various managers and tools will appear in this section. When you first log in, it will provide news and basic information about your site.

If you find that you use a specific section of the AdminCP often, you can save your expanded layout using the controls under the logo at the top of the navigation column.

## Getting Help

vBulletin has a lot of settings, options, and controls within the AdminCP. This is to allow the software to fit a wide number of different community uses and to allow you to build a custom site. In order to assist new site administrators, extensive documenation has been built into the AdminCP. This appears as inline documentation and within a pop-up help system. To access the help, click on the question mark icon in the right column of the tool that you're using.

<< Show one of the sections under Settings -> Options. Highlight inline description and show the popup help. >>

## Adding additional administrators

If needed, you can create multiple administrators on your site. These administrators can help you run your site.

1. To add a new administrator, you would need to search for the user that you want to promote.

2. To do this today, I am going to use the quick search on the AdminCP home page.

3. Enter in the user's name or email address into the search field.

- If there are multiple results, you'll see a list to choose from. If it is just a single user, the system will go directly to the User Manager.

4. In the Usergroup box, assign the user's primary group to Administrators.

5. Scroll to the bottom and save.

6. The system will reload the User Search tool. There will be links at the top to view the previous user's profile and manage their Administrator Permissions.

7. Click on the red text labeled **Update or Add Administration Permissions**

8. Set the permissions that you want to grant to Yes. Without this step, the new Administrator will not be able to perform many functions within the AdminCP.
