### Reputation Display

- Reputation levels moved to User Ranks. Redundant Systems removed.
- Admins can control the look and feel of reputation on their sites easier with User Ranks than the previous system. Instead of relying on a hardcoded algorithm in which the graphic and reputation level would get out of sync, it is all controlled via the User Rank Manager.
- To add new Reputation Levels, you simply need to add a new rank within the Reputation Rank Group.
