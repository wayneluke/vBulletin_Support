Hello.

There is no official import service to vBulletin however our previous software, Impex, is available as an open source tool which you could use for this:

http://www.vbulletin.com/go/impex

Please note that this was never designed to work in vB5, only up to vB4 and as such, you would need to:

- install vB4 on your server
- perform the import to there
- upgrade to vB5

Please note that we also no longer provide official support for this in the ticket system, you will need to post at vBulletin.org for any assistance with this.
