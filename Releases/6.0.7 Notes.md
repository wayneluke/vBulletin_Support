## Export Node Event

Need notes on importing these on Windows and Android. Need to test with iOS/MacOS.


## SIGPIC Improvements

The editor doesn't update new image until reload.

- Script added to move sigpics from older installs. The directory option is lost during the 5.0.0. upgrade so we cannot do this automatically. This script will not overwrite existing sigpics.
- Current upgrades from 4.2.5 will move the signature pictures. 


## Option Validation

This has been refactored for better security. Doesn't affect most users but is necessary for custom code. This also allows for improved error messaging on invalid options.

List validation types.

Custom Validation requires a class. Examples will be provided.
