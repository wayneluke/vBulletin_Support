1. Run Queries: A basic query editor. Make sure to look at the table drop down because table prefixes are not standardized. Feedback is basic but it will run Queries. Successful query results can be downloaded.
2. DB Backup: Create an ad hoc database backup and optionally provide FTP credentials to the customer. Customers can also request this from their Cloud Console and Member's area.
3. Import DB: Starts a migration with a customer's database and option attachments, avatars, and smilies. To get the files, see the Canned Response - "Cloud Support: Migration". This should be sent to the customer to start the migration.
4. Import Demo: Customers can have us import existing demos with this form. We cannot restore inaccessible/expired demos for this purpose.
5. Restore: Restore the site to a previous database backup. We do site backups every night. These are retained for 20 days. If a site is restored to an older backup, any newer content will be deleted.
6. Repair Tables: Obsolete
7. Reinstall Forum: Deletes all content and starts the site over from the beginning.
