You can update your header navigation items with this [[Site Builder]] tool.

1. Click "Edit Site" next to your username on the page linked above.  
2. Click "Navigation Bar".  
3. Click "Add Navigation Item" for each link. 

In the resulting dialog box you will add a name for the link and the URL it should link to. If you want to link to a page within vBulletin, you can choose it from the drop down page list if you donâ€™t know the specific URL. 

You can also assign view permissions in this system at this stage. This will allow you to show different links based on usergroup.
