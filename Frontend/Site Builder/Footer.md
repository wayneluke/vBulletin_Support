## What is the Footer?

The footer is a list of navigation links that appear at the bottom of the site. With Site Builder, you’re able to add links to the footer that can take your users anywhere you want them to go. These items behave similarly to Navigation Links in the Navigation Bar. Unlike the Navigation Bar, the footer doesn't allow for sub-navigation menus. Any changes to the Footer are global and apply to all pages.

## Accessing the Footer Controls.

To add a navigation item to your site, make sure that Site Builder is turned on by clicking the <button>Edit Site</button> button in the user menu at the top of the page. Once the Site Builder menu appears, click on the Footer link.

## How to add a Footer Link

Click on the Footer link in the menu to open the Footer Editor under the Site Builder Menu. Within the editor, click the <button>New Navigation Item</button> link. A dialog will appear where you can enter the name of the Navigation Link and the URL of its destination. When you are finished adding items, click the “Save Changes” link, and your page will reload with the changes.

1. Click "Edit Site" next to your username on the page linked above.  
2. Click “Footer”.  
3. Click "Add Navigation Item" for each link.  
  
> The footer does not support sub-navigation links.

### Formatting your URLs

- If you are creating a link to a location outside of vBulletin, you must use a fully qualified URL. E.g., https://example.com/mylink.html.
- For links leading into your site, Use a relative URL. For example to link to the Articles page, you can use use the URL of `/articles`.
- If you are linking to a Page within the vBulletin system, you can also tie your link to the route of that Page. All pages will be listed in a drop down provided for this purpose.


### Link Attributes

The Link Attribute field allows you to add custom CSS or Javascript to your link. Follows the standard format of an HTML anchor tag. Do not include opening or closing angle brackets (<>) as this may break your site.

CSS Example: `class="myclass"`
Javascript Example:  `onclick="alert('Hey there!')`

### Footer Link Permissions

If you wish to have the link visible to specific usergroups, then click on the Edit link under Usergroups. Select the groups that should be able to view the link. To have the link appear to all usergroups, do not select any or select "All Usergroups".
