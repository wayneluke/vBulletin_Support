 Pages are the basis of the vBulletin front-end and can be controlled within the Site Builder system. There are several types of pages in vBulletin. System, Channel, and Custom Pages. 

## Page Manager

### System Pages 
 
 cannot be removed and may contain modules (content blocks) that are required for that page. However, System Pages can be edited and have optional modules added or removed to customize the page. You can also create Custom Pages. These can be added and deleted and may contain any number of modules. You can access your custom pages by clicking on the Pages link.

### Custom Pages

This is a list of all custom pages that you or other administrators have created on the site. Clicking on the page link will take you to that page.

## All Pages

This shows a list of all channel (Forums, Article Sections, Blogs, Social Groups) pages created on the site. Clicking on the page link will take you that page.

  

## Orphaned Page Templates

When you create a custom page, a new template is created along with it. When you delete the page, the template isn't deleted automatically because it may have been used multiple times. Any custom page templates that aren't being used by current pages will be listed here. You can clean up your template list by deleting unused templates.

A page is rendered using a [[Page Template]]. This template is comprised of the [[Layouts]] and [[Modules]] along with a title and URL.
