Layouts are used to create the basic column structure of [[Pages]]. In vBulletin, a layout provides a number sections in which to place Modules. There are at least 5 sections per layout. These include a header global section, a 100% header section, one or more columns for general content modules, a 100% footer section and a footer global section.
