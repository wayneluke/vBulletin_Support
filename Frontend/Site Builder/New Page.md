 vBulletin comes with a variety of basic pages created when you first install or upgrade to it. However you may wish to add custom pages for a variety of reasons. At the end of this article, we will walk you through an example of making a page for your site. 

In order to create a page, you need to turn on Site Builder. You do that by clicking <button>Edit Site</button> to the right of your username. This will reveal a menu along the top of your webpage. From here, you want to click on the “New Page” link. This opens the Page Editor with four tabs. These are: Add Module, Layouts, Template, and Color Style. 

## Modules

This opens a form with three tabs. For the moment, start with the **Add Module** tab in the form. Modules are the blocks and components used to build [[Pages]]. Each modules has a variety of options to control how it operates on a page and who has permission to view it. 

You can see a list of the modules you can use in custom pages at [[Modules]]

## Layouts

Layouts are used to create the basic column structure of [[Pages]]. In vBulletin, a layout provides a number sections in which to place Modules. There are at least 5 sections per layout. These include a header global section, a 100% header section, one or more columns for general content modules, a 100% footer section and a footer global section. 

## Templates

In order to create a page, you need to turn on the [BUTTON]Edit Site[/BUTTON] function. You do that by clicking the “Off” button to the right of the Edit Site button. This will reveal a menu along the top of your webpage. From here, you want to click on the [BUTTON]New Page[/BUTTON] button.

This opens a form with three tabs. For the moment, let’s stick to the <Add Module> tab in the form. vBulletin comes with a variety of basic pages created when you first install or upgrade to it. However you may wish to add custom pages for a variety of reasons. We will walk through an example of making a front page for your site. You can make this the first page that your users see when they arrive on your site. We’ll start with an Announcement module, an Activity Stream module, and an Online Users module

[NOTE]You don’t have to build your front page with these modules if you don’t want to. In fact, you can build it with a totally different set of modules depending on what you want to use your vBulletin for. Remember, this is just a tutorial to show you how to do things and not a hard guide. Have fun![/NOTE]

To find the modules, you can either use the Search field to the left of the module list or the slide bar beneath the menu. Once you’ve found these four modules, drag and drop them to the page. From here, you can move them around in whatever order you want. If you’re following along, we’ve set them up like this:

Ok, so, now that we have the page organized like we want, we’re going to play with the options for each one. Although each module has different options, the options can be accessed in the same way. Just click on the “Edit” button and a form will pop up with a choice of options.

In this tutorial, we’ll work with the Activity Stream module and just let the others go as their defaults. So, to continue, click on the “Edit” button. In the new form, change the “Show Filter” to “All” and then click the [BUTTON]Save[/BUTTON] button.

Go ahead and change the options for your other modules. Once you’re done, click the [BUTTON]Save Page[/BUTTON] button.

This opens a new form like the one above. On this form, enter a name for the page into the Page Name field. The URL for your page will automatically fill out with the name you entered for the page. If you want to change it, feel free to right now.  The last thing you want to do before saving is to name the new template that the save will generate along with your page. This saves the layout, order, and settings of the page so you can reuse it at a later time if you need to make another page likes this one.
