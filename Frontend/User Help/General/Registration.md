<p>The administrator will probably require you to register to make full use of the features of this site. Being registered gives you a unique username and identity on the board.
Registration is free unless otherwise specified and offers some or all of the following features depending how the administrator has configured the site:</p>
<div class="restore"><ul>
<li>Posting new topics</li>
<li>Replying to other peoples' topics</li>
<li>Editing your content</li>
<li>Sending private messages to other members</li>
<li>Subscribing to content</li>
<li>Create a unique signature to use in posts</li>
<li>Upload a custom Avatar</li>
</ul></div>

<h2>How do I register?</h2>
<p>You register by clicking the Log In or Sign Up link near the top of the page, and then on Sign Up in the box that opens. You will be asked to choose a user name, password, and enter a valid email address. You may be asked your birth date to determine your age. In addition there will be some other fields which you will be invited to respond, some may be mandatory. Once this is complete you will either be fully registered, or in some cases you may receive an email from which you must follow a link to confirm your address and complete registration. Finally in some cases the Administrator may require a waiting period while he or she verifies your account.</p>
<p>You will have to agree to the terms of service or forum rules before registration can be completed. A link will be provided allowing you to review the site rules before agreeing. </p>
<p>Note: Entering your email address will not leave you open to "spam" as it will not be shared with other forum users, only the site staff unless you specify otherwise.</p>
<p>Depending how the site is configured you may be able to bypass some or all of the registration steps if you choose to "Connect with Facebook" which, if available, will connect this site with your existing Facebook account.</p>
<p>If you are under the age of 13 the administrator may require that a parent or guardian provide consent before allowing you to complete the registration process. More information about this is available during the registration process if required.</p>
