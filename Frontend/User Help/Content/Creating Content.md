A topic is a general term for a discussion in a forum or group, a blog entry, and an article. All of these can be created using this information. Topics can hold one or more posts of various content types such as traditional text based posts, shared pictures, links or videos, or polls.

## New Topics

To create a new topic click on the `+ New Topic` button when browsing a forum or group. In Blog it will say `+ New Blog Entry`. In an Article channel, it will say `+ New Article`.

You will be presented with a screen where you must give a title (or subject) of the topic and optionally choose a topic prefix if available. A topic prefix will appear before the title and will contain a list of one or more prefixes chosen by the site administrator to better categorize your topic. Clicking on a thread prefix in forum view will show a list of topics with the same prefix.

### Content Types

Underneath the title, you will see several icons representing your available content  choices. These can include:

 - `fas:Camera` (Gallery): Choosing to create a Gallery will open an interface where you can upload one or more photos. Each photo can be given its own title and description. You can also drag and drop them into a preferred order.
- `fas:Link` (Link) : Choosing the Link icon will allow you to share a Link or Video from external site in order to discuss this item. Only one link is allow per post.
- `fas:Poll` (Poll) : This allows you to start a new poll on the site. Unlike all the other options a poll can only be inserted as the first post in a topic. Choosing to insert poll will allow you to ask a poll question and provide 2 or more options for users to vote on.
- `fas:CalendarAlt` (Event) : Along with your description, each event can have a start and end time. There is also a field for an optional location. Depending on the site's configuration the location can be converted into a map when saved. Events also show up in Calendar related searches.
- Text: This is the default content type if none of the above are selected.

### Editor Features

On the right side of the editing tools, there are several editor choices. These show or hide different panels in the Editor. The server will remember your choices here for the next time you create a topic.

- `fas:Font` Advanced Editor :  This will open an **Editing** toolbar directly over your post. This allows you to easily apply formatting and other BBCode. 
- `fas:Paperclip` Attachments - Opens up the attachment interface. This will allow you to attach allowed file formats to your post in order to share them with others.
- `fas:Smile` Smiley : Opens the smilie manager under your post. Clicking on individual smilies will insert them into the post at the cursor location.

#### Rich Text Format

When posting messages you may wish to include some formatting such as **bold** text, _italic_ text or underline text.

Adding Rich Text formatting to a post can be done in either of two ways:

- Using clickable buttons in the Advanced editor similar to those found in word processors
- Typing in BB Codes around text manually

Clickable buttons are available in the Advanced Editing Toolbar. Click on the A icon in the editor to toggle the Advanced editor controls.

To use clickable buttons simply click the button, for example the B (bold) button and then type to get bold text. Click the button again to stop using that formatting. You can also highlight text that you have already typed then click the formatting button to format existing text. Some buttons like the one for inserting images provide for more advanced options such as formatting controls and upload options.

BB Code is a special set of codes similar to HTML that can be used in posts. BBCodes are formatted in one of two ways:

Simple BB Code like bold text consist of just an opening and closing tag:` [B]Example[/B]` becomes **Example**.

Advanced BB Codes use an option in addition to an opening and closing tag. URL BB Code is an example of an advanced BB Code.  
`[URL=http://www.vbulletin.com]Link to vBulletin[/URL]` becomes [Link to vBulletin](http://www.vbulletin.com/). In this example the vBulletin.com URL is the option.

Site Administrators may create custom BB Codes in addition to the built in BB Codes with buttons in the Advanced editor.

#### Auto Save

The system will automatically attempt to save a draft of your new content as you type. The autosave happens every minute. This way you will not lose your content if called away or you refresh the page.

#### Auto Grow

The editor panel will automatically grow as you type so you have plenty of room to format your content. You can also drag the editor to a larger size by clicking on the drawer in the bottom border and dragging. The server will remember your resizing if done in this manner.

#### Drag and Drop

You can drag and drop images from your computer into the editor for placement in your content. You can also move images around or resize them in the content using this manner. Alternatively, you can double click on an image to resize or change its alignment. Text will flow around the image.

### Tags

You may also have the option to add tags to the topic. Tags are optional keywords that  describe the topic. Click on the Tags +  link to add tags. Press enter after each tag you enter. You may also click on popular tags to add them. Press the X icon next to any tag to remove it.  Press Save when done adding tags or cancel to discard the tags.



### Submitting

When you have completed your post you may preview or post the new content. Upon pressing Post a new topic will be created.

## Replies

When you enter a topic, you will be able to reply and/or comment to that topic. The editor works the same way as above and will appear at the bottom of the current page. 

## Comments

Comments are available on Articles and Blogs. These do not show the full editor. As such, they do not support Rich Text Editing but you may still use BBCode.
