Within the Message Center, there are several sections of interest to Administrators and Moderators. These two groups will be referenced as "Staff Members" for the remainder of this section.

- Moderation - This contains all unapproved posts that need to be reviewed. Staff Members can approve or delete items listed in this section.
- Flag Reports - These are items that members of the community have reported for violation of the rules. Staff Members can review the reports, view the reported content, and choose to ignore the report or delete the content.
- Infractions - Lists all the infractions handed out to the site's users. Staff Members can view the infractions and discuss the infractions in this interface.
- Deleted Items - Shows all soft-deleted items in the system. Items here can be restored to their original location or permanently deleted based on the staff member's permissions.
