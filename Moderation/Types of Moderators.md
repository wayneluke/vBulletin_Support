The levels of moderation staff (often referred to as site staff) is made up of individual users assigned as Moderators, Super Moderators, and Administrators on the site. Super Moderator and Administrator access is controlled by the usergroups that these individuals belong to.

### Moderators 

Moderators are users who are put in charge of maintaining one or more channels. Moderators are appointed by the vBulletin Administrator. Moderator responsibilities can include deleting offensive or inappropriate posts, pruning old threads, and banning users from their channels. Moderator responsibilities are “assigned” to moderators through permissions.  
  
The Administrator can assign a moderator to one or more channels by adding them in the Channel Manager screen. For organizational and to apply custom titles and/or ranks, moderators can optionally include these users within the Moderators usergroup as Primary or Secondary members.

### Super Moderators


Administrators can also create Super Moderators by setting the user's primary usergroup to Super Moderator in the AdminCP's User Manager. Super Moderators have the same permission access as Moderators. However, these permissions apply to all channels on the system.

### Administrators

Administrators have the same moderation permissions Super Moderators have. In addition to this, they can access the AdminCP. AdminCP access comes with another layer of permissions that controls what they have access to in that system.
