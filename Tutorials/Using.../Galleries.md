Galleries are channels with specialized permissions on creation. At the base level Gallery Channels look and behave like Forum Channels. They have these changes applied:

1. These channels are created under Galleries in the Channel Manager (AdminCP → Channel Management → Channel Manager).
2. Galleries also have their own navigation tab by default.
3. Galleries are configured to only allow Photo Gallery content to be created. All other content types are disabled by default. If you want to non-gallery replies and/or comments, you will need to allow the Text content type to be created by the usergroup.
4. The channel view defaults to the Photos tab to show the images of the gallery.
5. Accesible to all users with default permissions. Galleries provide global photo albums that allow users to share their images.

## Viewing Images

All images will be shown as Cards using the CSS Grid layout. This will adjust to the available space of the device or browser. Clicking on any image thumbnail will open the channel in the standard lightbox so users can view the image in more detail. Clicking on an image in the lightbox will open it at full size.

## Uploading Images

The system will use the standard Photo Gallery content type. Users can add images from their local device or from images they have uploaded to previous posts. Only images are allowed to be added to the Gallery Topics.
## Searching your Galleries
Images are not indexed for keywords. To allow your galleries to be searched, you should encourage users to add a title and description to each image they upload in a new topic. This information can be added after uploading the images.  Users can also add optional text to describe their new topic like any standard post.

## Rearranging Images.
After uploading images can be dragged to new locations within the editing interface. This can be useful if you want images in a specific order but they finish uploading in the incorrect order. Simply click or tap on an image and hold. Then you can drag it to its new location.

## Turning off Galleries

If you don't want to use Galleries, you can turn them off using Site Builder's Quick Setup and uncheck Galleries under the type of content you want to offer. This will deny access to all usergroups and remove the Navigation tab.

You can also do this manually by setting the "Can View Channel" permission to No under Channel Management → Channel Permissions. You will also need to manually remove the tab.
