Google usually has several steps for placing ads.  
  
First they have code that should be in the header of every page. To add this, you will need to log into your AdminCP and go to Settings → Options → Search Engine Tools.  
On this page, set "Enable Google Verification" to Yes. Place the code they say to put into the header in the text box labeled "Google Verification HTML Tag." If there is already information in this box, add your code after it.  
  
While the boxes say "Google Verification," they will work for our current purposes as well.  
  
Once you have that completed, then you need to place your actual ads. Go to the front-page of your site. You can do this by clicking the "Site Home Page" at the top of the AdminCP.  
  
1. Visit the page where you want the ad to display. If you want them to display on all pages, then you can stay on the current page.  
2. Click "Edit Site" next to your username if you need to enable Site Builder.  
3. Click Edit Page in the Site Builder menu.  
4. Drag an Ad module to the page where you want the ad to display. If you want a global ad on every page, then place it in one of the two global areas. The global areas have a blue background and say they are global.  
5. Click on the Pencil icon to edit your new Ad module.  
6. Give it a title and set the options.  
7. Click "Edit" next to Config Ad.  
8. Give the Ad a title and paste your code into the HTML Box.  
9. Set the Ad to Active with the option provided.  
10. Change other options as you wish but you can probably just save here.  
11. After saving the module, click "Save Page" and save the page on your site.  
  
The ad should start appearing immediately following the options you provided.
